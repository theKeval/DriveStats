/**
 * Calculates a proxy Efficiency Score [0, 100] for a trip.
 *
 * This is a **behavioural proxy** – it does not measure actual fuel/energy consumption.
 * It penalises driving patterns known to waste energy:
 * - Idling events
 * - Speeding (aerodynamic drag increases dramatically above 100 km/h)
 * - Repeated harsh acceleration (accelerating hard then braking wastes kinetic energy)
 * - Repeated hard braking (kinetic energy converted to heat)
 * - Excessive stop-start sequences
