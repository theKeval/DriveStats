# DriveStats

A local-first, explainable driving analytics app that scores safety, smoothness, efficiency, and trip quality from start point to end point using only the phone's sensors and location stack.

## Architecture

DriveStats follows Google's recommended Android architecture with unidirectional data flow:

```
UI Layer (Compose + ViewModel)
    ↕ UI State (StateFlow)
Domain Layer (Scoring calculators, domain models)
    ↕ Repository interface
Data Layer (Room database, DAOs, Mappers)
    ↕ Android Platform APIs
Platform (FusedLocationProvider, ActivityRecognition, SensorManager)
```

## Scoring model

All scores are in the range [0, 100] where 100 is best.

| Score | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Safety** | Speeding, hard braking, harsh acceleration, aggressive cornering, phone distraction. Night driving and long trips act as context multipliers. |
| **Smoothness** | Jerk, abrupt acceleration/deceleration, aggressive cornering harshness, excessive stop-start patterns. |
| **Efficiency** | Behavioural proxy: idling time, overspeed duration, repeated harsh acceleration/braking, stop-start cycles. |
| **Trip Quality** | Weighted aggregate (Safety 40 %, Smoothness 30 %, Efficiency 30 %) with signal-confidence adjustment. Displayed as 0–5 ★ in 0.5-star steps. |

## Tech stack

| Component | Library |
|---|---|
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| Navigation | Navigation Compose |
| DI | Hilt |
| Local DB | Room |
| Background work | WorkManager |
| Trip detection | Activity Recognition Transition API |
| Location | Fused Location Provider |
| Motion sensors | Android SensorManager (accelerometer + gyroscope) |
| Preferences | DataStore Preferences |
| Permissions UI | Accompanist Permissions |

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in Android Studio Hedgehog or later.
3. Sync Gradle.
4. Run on a device or emulator with Google Play Services (required for Activity Recognition and Fused Location).

> **Note:** Background location (`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`) is requested separately after the user grants foreground location, in compliance with Google Play policy. Auto-detection (the feature that depends on background location) can be disabled in Settings.

## Privacy design

- **Trip-only collection by default.** Location and motion data are only recorded while a trip is active.
- **Local-first.** All data is stored on-device in Room. Cloud sync is an opt-in setting (backend not yet implemented).
- **Transparent recording.** A persistent foreground notification is shown whenever a trip is being recorded.
- **User control.** Users can delete any trip, mark any trip as passenger, and toggle auto-detection off at any time.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Discovery & calibration spike (collect labeled drives, tune thresholds)
- [x] MVP trip lifecycle (this PR)
- [ ] ML-based event detectors (hard braking transformer model)
- [ ] Map display on trip detail screen
- [ ] Cloud sync backend + WorkManager upload worker
- [ ] OBD integration for real efficiency metrics
- [ ] Play Store privacy declaration + beta hardening
